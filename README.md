# Two Bit Multiplier in Proteus
A simple two's complement two bit multiplier developed in Proteus.
This is a good example for developing simple circuits in Proteus for novice logic designers.

The truth tables and Karnaugh's maps for the functions are uploaded in the form of a PDF.

What it does is, basically it receives two, two bit numbers in two's complement and shows their product on two 
7-segments; one for the sign and one for the value itself.
