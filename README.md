# Two Bit Multiplier
A simple two's complement two bit multiplier developed in Proteus.
This is a perfect example onfor developing simple circuits in Proteus for novice logic designers.

What it does is, basically it receives two, two bit numbers in two's complement and shows their product on two 

7-segments; one for the sign and one for the value itself.
